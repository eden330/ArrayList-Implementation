# ArrayList-Implementation
This is a Java project implementing a custom ArrayList data structure from scratch. 
The custom ArrayList provides functionality similar to the built-in ArrayList class in Java,
allowing for dynamic resizing and manipulation of a list of elements.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of how ArrayLists work internally by implementing one from scratch.
The custom ArrayList class offers most of the ArrayList methods such as: methods for adding, removing, accessing, and modifying elements in the list.
It also includes features such as dynamic resizing to accommodate a variable number of elements.
